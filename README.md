## 🌟 Highlights
- **Modular Design:** Two learning algorithms are used **Diffusion (DDPM, DDIM)** and **Super-Resolution (ST-transformer)** trained independently.
- **Dataset:** Uses **five public datasets** with varying preprocessing and postprocessing inlcuding resize, rotation and crop.
- **Diffusion:** Uses simple denoisinng diffusion probabilistic model for syntehsis with a attention-aware UNet backbone.
- **SR:** Built upon **HAT-SR** with novel losses - pixel-wise loss (L_1), perceptual loss (L_percep), and adversarial loss (L_GAN).
- **Real-vs-Fake Quiz:** A time-limited human in the loop activity to identify a given image as real or synthetic? Six dentists with varying experience were invited to play the quiz for 200 images (100 real and 100 fake).

## 🧠 Overview

  <em>Figure: General principle of synthetic image generation through manifold representation. Consider a dataset of images {x<sub>k</sub>}<sub>k=1</sub><sup>n</sup>, where x<sub>k</sub> ∼ p(x). These images serve as samples from the target distribution p(x). A best sampler G<sub>θ</sub> is one such that x̂ = G<sub>θ</sub>(z), where z ∼ 𝒩(0, I), to produce high-quality samples resembling the true data distribution p.</em>

  <br>
  <em>Figure: Working of PanoDiff in three key steps: (1) In the forward phase, noise is added to the input image x<sub>t=0</sub> over t=1000 time steps, following a β-schedule (slow-start and fast-finish). The plot on the right shows pixel variation metrics converging to 0.5 because the image is pure noise at t=1000. (2) The reverse phase (in left) involves training a U-Net (using L<sub>1</sub> loss), shown on the left, such that it takes a random source image with a random noisy image at t. The trained U-Net predicts most of the noise given a noisy image at t. For comparison, an old method is shown (in right), which performs denoising through a slow, stochastic, step-by-step process, requiring hundreds to thousands of iterations to gradually remove noise using the frozen U-Net from the previous step (on the left). (3) The image generation process in PanoDiff involves iteratively predicting and removing noise from a noisy image x<sub>t=0</sub> using a frozen U-Net, resulting in a slightly less noisy image. The resulting image is added with noise and fed to the U-Net, which again predicts and removes noise. This process continues for <em>inference</em> time steps.</em>
